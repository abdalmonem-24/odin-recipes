    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>Kofta is a family of meatball or meatloaf dishes originating from the Middle East, South Asia, and Central Asia. It typically consists of minced meat, usually beef, lamb, chicken, pork, or a combination, mixed with spices and herbs. The meat is pounded or ground to a fine consistency, hence the Persian word “kūfta” meaning “to beat or to grind”.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground meat (beef, lamb, or combination)</il>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons breadcrumbs (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine ground meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, parsley, cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Mix well with your hands or a wooden spoon until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>If using breadcrumbs, add them to the mixture and mix until they’re evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Cover the mixture and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Thread the kofta mixture onto skewers, leaving a small space between each kofta.</li>
        <li>Brush the koftas with olive oil and cook for 4-6 minutes per side, or until they’re cooked through and slightly charred.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your choice of sides, such as rice, grilled vegetables, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce.</li>
    </ol>
